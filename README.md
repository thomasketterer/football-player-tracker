# Football Player Tracker

My goal for this project is to create a program that can turn american football film into data that can be used by coaches. 
The main goals for this program are to translate player movement on all 22 film and endzone film into drawn play concepts, translate those plays into data, and then use models to predict which plays are going to be run next

My goal for March is to create the part of the program that can be used to detect players and display them on a image of a field. This includes tracking camera movement so that it can keep the players correct position while the camera moves.
The hardest part of this, I imagine, will be to track the movement of the linemen and running back since they will be all very close together making recognizing each individual person difficult.
